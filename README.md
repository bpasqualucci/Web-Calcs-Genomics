# Web-Calcs-Genomics

File labeled "code" contains a python script for use in determining a plaque maxWeb plate, the titer of a phage sample, and the needed volume of a dilution to create a maxWeb plate. This script was written while parcipitating the HHMI Sea Phages program. The script will prompt for imputs of plate diameter, plaque diamter, the volume added to the culture that was plated, and the number of PFU. It will take this data and display the volumes in mL and uL needed for maxWeb, the titer, the PFU maxWeb and the volumes needed for /4, /2, MaxWeb, x2, and x4 that the empirical test protocol suggests plating. 

Will probally edit the script so that the user can select what they wish to do. For example, if you already know your titer and want to find MaxWeb without entering everything over again. 

The file "dilution calcs" is a WIP that would take the preivious script and use its data to produce the volumes needed to be transfered to have enought sample in each dilution tube to produce an empirical maxWeb test. The code itself is fine and does what it should, however, the sample to culture amounts need to be manually entered. THis would be automated when the two files are merged.
