# Web-Calcs-Genomics

code is the file for Plate Max web calcs, what it is trying to do is find the needed concentration of sample to create a fully occupied plate
the other file, dilution calcs, will take the volume values from the code file and determine the dilution tube values needed to create the dilution sereies to create the web plate. Words, science lack of explanation.


So these phage make these circles called plaques. And I want a plate full of nothing but circles. the code file, tells me what concentration of phage to pipette to make the full circle  plate.

Problem is I got those tubes right, a series of tubes. All in a row. 10**0, 10**-1 etc. And each tube is a power dilution lower than the other. So I gotta pull the right volume out of the right tube. Also I have to make sure I have enough stuff in the tube to put it in all the places I have to put it. 

I'll put this into better words, at a later date. Mabye even explain whats happening! 
I'm glad nobody important will read this. You know, like my professor.
